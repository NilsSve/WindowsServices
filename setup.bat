REM  WindowsServices - one-time setup
REM
REM  The libraries this workspace needs are NOT stored in this repository (see
REM  .gitignore). This script provides them, and it behaves differently by
REM  machine so that one arrangement serves both maintainer and user:
REM
REM    * If a shared RDC library pool sits next to this workspace (a sibling
REM      ..\Libraries folder carrying the marker file .rdc-library-pool), it
REM      makes Libraries\ a JUNCTION to that pool. One shared, editable copy:
REM      a fix made in a library here is a fix in the pool.
REM
REM    * Otherwise it CLONES the libraries it needs (DFAbout,
REM      RDCToolsLib, vwin32fh) into this workspace's own Libraries\ folder -
REM      isolated, self-contained, and it never writes anywhere outside this
REM      workspace, so it cannot disturb libraries you already have elsewhere.
REM
REM  Re-run any time Libraries\ looks missing or out of date.
